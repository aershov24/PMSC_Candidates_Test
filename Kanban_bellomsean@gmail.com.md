**Answer:**

**Kanban** is a Project Management tool that allows you to get a **more visual overview** of the tasks that either need to get done or are complete.

At its core, it consists of a physical or _digital board_ with three columns (_To Do, In Progress, Done_) and tasks listed as story cards. Every card will be pulled from left to right until it gets done. Finally, they will leave the workflow.

**With the help of Kanban, we can do the following;**
* Organize your work into projects
* Build project teams
* Invite people to join the team
* Share and collaborate on work to do- using online Kanban boards

Its **main goal**? To visualize and maintain the workflow while eliminating waste.

**Answer:**

To link card together in _Kanban_, there are two ways:

**You can use tags to link two cards:** First, you have to create cards and have to link cards using the same tag and then you can search all tasks linked using the search option

**Using unique URL:** Each card in _Kanban_ has unique URL, and you can copy this URL and paste it to another cardâ€™s external link fields.

## Q3: How does _Lean_ and _Six Sigma_ differ from each other or are they same or do they complement each other?

**Difficulty:** `Senior`

**Answer:**

Even though, both _Lean_ and _Six Sigma_ focus on **waste reduction and improving efficiency**.

The key difference lies in the fact that;

* **Six Sigma** is more inclined towards reducing the wastage margin towards `99.9999%`, strives for near perfect results that will reduce costs and achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction.

* **Lean** is focused on setting up the right processes, the efficient pipeline, the culture and mindset of waste reduction. Analyzing workflow to reduce cycle time and eliminate waste and strives to maximize value to the customer while using a few resources as possible.

One similarity between _Lean_ vs _Six Sigma_ is that both have demonstrated that it is possible to dramatically improve the quality of your products and customer experience by improving processes. And [as this article points out](https://hbr.org/2011/03/uniting-the-religions-of-proce), when most companies set out to improve inefficient processes they feel like must choose only one method going forward.

Ultimately, the issue may not be whether you should choose _Lean_ vs _Six Sigma_ but how you can take the elements you like from each and apply them to solve problems in your own business.


So overall, it can be said that once we have matured _Lean_ production in the organization then _Six Sigma_ can be put on top of it.
