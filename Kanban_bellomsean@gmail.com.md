**Answer:**

**Kanban** is a Project Management tool that allows you to get a **more visual overview** of the tasks that either need to get done or are complete.

At its core, it consists of a physical or _digital board_ with three columns (_To Do, In Progress, Done_) and tasks listed as story cards. Every card will be pulled from left to right until it gets done. Finally, they will leave the workflow.

**With the help of Kanban, we can do the following;**
* Organize your work into projects
* Build project teams
* Invite people to join the team
* Share and collaborate on work to do- using online Kanban boards

Its **main goal**? To visualize and maintain the workflow while eliminating waste.

## Q2: Explain how you can link a card together in _Kanban_?

**Answer:**

To link card together in _Kanban_, there are two ways:

**You can use tags to link two cards:** First, you have to create cards and have to link cards using the same tag and then you can search all tasks linked using the search option

**Using unique URL:** Each card in _Kanban_ has unique URL, and you can copy this URL and paste it to another card’s external link fields.

## Q3: What is the difference between _DMAIC_ and _DMADV_ in Six Sigma?

**Answer:**

* **DMAIC** stands for: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control
* **DMADV** stands for: Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify

Despite the first three shared letters of their names, there are some notable differences:
* **DMAIC** typically defines a business process and how it applies; **DMADV** defines customer needs as they relate to a service or product.
* **DMAIC** measures the current performance of a process, while **DMADV** measures customer specifications and needs.
* **DMAIC** focuses on making improvements to a business process to reduce or eliminate defects. **DMADV** develops an appropriate business model to meet customer requirements.

## Q4: What is the role of the _1.5 Sigma Shift_?

**Difficulty**: `Senior`

**Source:**
https://www.qualitydigest.com/inside/six-sigma-column/15-sigma-shift-explained-040406.html

**Answer:**

Experience has shown that processes usually do not perform as well in the _long term_ as they do in the short term. As a result, the number of sigmas that will fit between the process mean and the nearest specification limit (SL) may well drop over time, compared to an initial short-term study. To account for this real-life increase in _process variation_ over time, an _empirically_ based 1.5 sigma shift is introduced into the calculation.

According to this idea, a process that fits 6 sigma between the process mean and the nearest specification limit in a short-term study will in the long term fit only 4.5 sigma – either because the process mean will move over time, or because the long-term standard deviation of the process will be greater than that observed in the short term, or both.

**NOTE**: With the introduction of the 1.5 Sigma Shift the "6 sigma" process will have long-term defect rates corresponding to 4.5 sigma performance rather than actual 6 sigma performance.

In practice, the 1.5 sigma shift results in the generally accepted six sigma value of **3.4 defects per million** opportunities:

_Ignoring_ the 1.5 sigma shift results in a six sigma value of **2 defects per billion** opportunities:
