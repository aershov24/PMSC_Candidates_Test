**Answer:**

If the team is asking for more work because they think they can do more then obvious choice is to allow them, but it should be done in a proper manner. The below steps should be followed:
* This should be discussed with the team first on **why** they think they are able to take up more tasks and if that discussion is **positive** then arrive at a consensus on **the revised upwards value of _WIP_ limit**. 
* That limit should be **approved** by the _project manager_, _product owner_, and _sponsors_.

After the approval, it can be implemented.

## Q2: Mark wants to use his team's Kanban board to focus only on _cycle time_ in his project. What should he adjust on the Kanban board?

**Answer:**

_Cycle time_ in a user story is focused just on the **coding** and **testing** of a user story. The other stages are part of _lead time_, but not _cycle time_. _Cycle time_ includes only the **specific completion of an assignment**, not the definition or deployment of the assignment.

**Details**:
When teams master Kanban on the team level, they start delivering value faster than ever before. However, when all parts of a project start moving even faster, it becomes a real challenge to get the bigger picture and figure out the actual state of affairs. This increased team velocity requires a new way of tracking project status. Please explain how Kanban can help in this situation?

**Answer:**

* **A two-tier Kanban model** governs the flow of features at the team level, and the direction that the team receives from the Product Owner on a sprint-to-sprint basis. Epics flow through the top-level process flow. 
* **The Portfolio level team** governs that rate of flow by making smaller investments, limiting work in process, managing capacity against demand, and identifying the removing bottlenecks from the system. Features flow through the second tier of the Kanban in a similar fashion, with the program level team governing the rate of flow at the team level, breaking down User Stories, and feeding the backlogs of each of the teams working across the program. 
* **From the team’s point of view**, it is simply Scrum. 

At the Enterprise, the flow of value is made visible and managed by implementing the two-tier Kanban system (Exhibits 1 and 2).
