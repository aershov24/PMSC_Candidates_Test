**Difficulty:** `mid`

**Answer:**

WIP means Work In Progress. This is a tool used in kanban to set limits of maximum work that can exist in each status of workflow. It is a valuable tool to Kanban because:

* It improves throughput and reduces the amount of work "nearly done", encourages the culture of "done" by forcing the team to focus on a small set of tasks. More importantly WIP makes sure blockers and bottlenecks are visible.Teams can swarm around blocking issues to get them understood, implemented and resolved where there is a clear indicator of what existing work is causing the bottleneck. These bebefits guarantee that increments of value are delivered to customers sooner.

* Secondly, multitasking is deceptively time intensive. During development its easy to think "oh will pause on this one issue while I begin another" having two issues open means context switching between two different things. Ramping down on one issue and up on another isn't free-it takes time and degrades focus. It's almost always better to work through the original issue rather than starting and not completing new work. In other words, WIP limits discourages us from impeding our own workflow.

* Finally, WIP limits point out areas of chronic idleness or overload. They help the team see inefficiencies in the entire process rather than just the area in which they work.

## Q2:  List four typical Kanban classes of service and give a real life example of them.

**Answer:**

Kanban classes of service (CoS) are used to classify different types of work based on their priority, urgency or delivery time. All this classes are defined by focusing on the cost of delay (CoD), which helps to measure business impact if something is done later than earlier or first instead. It works as a perfect guiding tool for task prioritization. Below are some typical Kanban classes of service.

* **Expedite** - Reserved for high urgency high impact items. Cost of delay rises fast over time for such tasks.

* **Fixed deadline** - Dedicated to tasks which have a deadline, such tasks become important over time and can be ordered based on how close their deadline is. Cost of delay can jump instantly if deadline is missed.

* **Standard** - Location for all regular tasks they should be ordered with first in, first out (FIFO) principle. Cost of delay for such tasks grows faster in the early days but then plateaus over time as they have no fixed date or strict urgency.

* **Intangible** - Made up of tasks that usually do not have a tangible cost of delay a good example could be maintenance work. Note that cost of delay overtime can change based on new risk or context updates.

A great real life example for the above Kanban classes of service could be the airport security checkpoints, where there are usually at least few types of lanes - regular lanes, priority lanes for families with kids and disabled people and fast track. By picking your lane you already have some expectations, you know your situation and what can be done about it. If you are late you will pay for fast track, if you are on time and have no issues standing in the queue, you will go for regular lane. Same applies for business processes which throughput work. Kanban systerm is exactly about organizing and executing planned work, while classes of service helps to manage expectation and define structure for process.

## Q3: What are the differences between Kanban and Scrum ?

**Difficulty:** `Junior`

**Answer:**

* Kanban is a framework used to implement agile and Devops software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are presented vissually on a Kanban board allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at anytime.

* Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. It encourages teams to learn through experiences, selforganize while work on a problem and reflect on their wins and losses to continually improve.

Kanban and Scrum are both agile frameworks with notable differences:

* Kanban is a continuous flow while the Scrum cadence is based on regular fixed lengh sprints ( 2 to 4 weeks) .

* Both have different practices, Kanban visualizes the flow of work, limits work in progress, manage flow and incorporate feedback loops. while Scrum practises sprint planning, sprint, daily scrum, sprint review and sprint restrospectives.

* There are no specific roles required in Kanban some teams might enlist the help of an agile coach. Whereas Scrum has specific roles which are product owner, scrum master and the development team.

* The kanban ideology is based on using visuals to improve work in progress meanwhile Scrum on the other hand is based on learn through experience, self organizing, prioritizing and reflecting on wins and losses to continuously improve.

* Kanban originates from lean manufacturing whereas Scrum originates from softwear development.
