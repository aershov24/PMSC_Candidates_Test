## Q1: What are some the importance of WIP in kanban ?

**Difficulty:** `mid`

**Answer:**

WIP means Work In Progress. This is a tool used in kanban to set limits of maximum work that can exist in each status of workflow. It is a valuable tool to Kanban because:

*  It improves throughput and reduces the amount of work "nearly done", encourages the culture of "done" by forcing the team to focus on a small set of tasks. More importantly WIP makes sure blockers and bottlenecks are visible.Teams can swarm around blocking issues to get them understood, implemented and resolved where there is a clear indicator of what existing work is causing the bottleneck. These bebefits guarantee that increments of value are delivered to customers sooner.

* Secondly, multitasking is deceptively time intensive. During development its easy to think "oh will pause on this one issue while I begin another" having two issues open means context switching between two different things. Ramping down on one issue and up on another isn't free-it takes time and degrades focus. It's almost always better to work through the original issue rather than starting and not completing new work. In other words, WIP limits discourages us from impeding our own workflow.

* Finlly, WIP limits point out areas of chronic idleness or overload. They help the team see inefficiencies in the entire process rather than just the area in which they work.

## Q2: What is lead time and cycle time ? How can they be used in Kanban?

**Answer:**

Lead time is the average time it takes for the team to deliver a product to client from the time it was requested ( appeared in the backlog ). While cycle time is the average time it takes for the team to complete an item from the time they started working in it. They are both metrics that can be used in Kanban as follows:

* Calculating the average lead time gives a good idea of the delivery speed and cycle time provides an indication of the team's speed Thus, following both and noting down changes can give you valuable insights into what is happening in your project now and what might be happening in the future.

* Lead time tracks the whole process from the initial request to the product delivery. Meaning you have a good idea of how long the production of an average item is going to take and can give the client a more accurate guess of delivery.

* Cycle time on the other hand focuses just on the production phase of the process. It aims to track and signal any issues in the production process focused only on manufacturing and testing can provide great insights into where your own process is lagging and could be improved. Could also signal that new roadblocks or issues have arisen.

* Lastly using a combinaition of the Kanban metrics allows the team to react to changes and adapt more quickly for example, if the team notices an increase in the cycle time it is safe to assume that the lead time will also grow. Thus, an increase in either of the metrics could signal a new roadblock or issue in the later project phases and a sudden decline could mean tasks are of a smaller size or the process has become more effective.

## Q3: What are the differences between Kanban and Scrum ?

**Difficulty:** `Junior`

**Answer:**

Kanban and Scrum are both agile frameworks with notable differences:

* Kanban is a continuous flow while the Scrum cadence is based on regular fixed lengh sprints ( 2 to 4 weeks) .

* Both have different practices, Kanban visualizes the flow of work, limits work in progress, manage flow and incorporate feedback loops. while Scrum practises sprint planning, sprint, daily scrum, sprint review and sprint restrospectives.

* There are no specific roles required in Kanban some teams might enlist the help of an agile coach. Whereas Scrum has specific roles which are product owner, scrum master and the development team.

* The kanban ideology is based on using visuals to improve work in progress meanwhile Scrum on the other hand is based on learn through experience, self organizing, prioritizing and reflecting on wins and losses to continuously improve.

* Kanban originates from lean manufacturing whereas Scrum originates from softwear development.
