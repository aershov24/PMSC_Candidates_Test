      The Kanban system can be adapted to existing workflows rather than overhauling everything.

   2. Limited task dependencies

      A work process where each task is relatively independent is best suited for Kanban
      
* Kanban must not be used in the opposite of these two cases : 

  1. Overhauling existing work processes (new paradigm)
  
  2. Projects where many tasks need interdepartmental collaboration
