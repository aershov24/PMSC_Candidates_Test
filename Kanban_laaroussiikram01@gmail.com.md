## Q3: When to use Kanban and when to avoid it ? give two examples in each case  

**Difficulty:** `Senior`

**Answer:**

* Kanban is perfect for project management when :

   1. Projects with incremental changes : 

      The Kanban system can be adapted to existing workflows rather than overhauling everything.

   2. Limited task dependencies

      A work process where each task is relatively independent is best suited for Kanban
      
* Kanban must not be used in the opposite of these two cases : Overhauling existing work processes and project where many tasks need interdepartmental collaboration
