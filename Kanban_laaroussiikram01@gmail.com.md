**Answer:**

The Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) is an analytical tool to kanban method, it allows teams to visualize their efforts and progress, In addition to correcting there mistakes since they will be able to counteract bottlenecks observed through the sudden rise or descent withen any band of tasks.
For example : reduce the work in progress if the band related to tasks "in progress" getting suddenly very tall.

We will do this by focusing our efforts on closing items that are already active instead of beginning work on new items. This will be represented by taking items out of the Active state, and putting them back in the New state, and in return, moving items from the Resolved state into the Closed state. Doing so will result in the following modified cumulative flow diagram:

By reducing our work in progress "WIP", We have reduced the time to deliver an item!

- In Scrum, the task structure is designed in such a way that it fits within the iteration, whereas in Kanban, there is no size limit for the task 
- Kanban use visuals to improve work in progress whereas in Scrum, we Learn from our experiences, wins and losses how to continuously improve.

## Q3: When to use Kanban and when to avoid it ? give two examples in each case  

**Difficulty:** `Senior`

https://monday.com/blog/project-management/kanban/

**Answer:**

* Kanban is perfect for project management, it is beneficial to use it in :

   1. Projects with incremental changes : The Kanban system can be adapted to existing workflows rather than overhauling everything.
   2. Limited task dependencies : A work process where each task is relatively independent is best suited for Kanban
      
* Kanban must not be used in the opposite of these two cases : 

  1. Overhauling existing work processes (new paradigm)
  2. Projects where many tasks need interdepartmental collaboration
