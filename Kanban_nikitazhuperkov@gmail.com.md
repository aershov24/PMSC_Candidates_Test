**Answer:**

The four mandatory flow measures to track are:

* WIP (Work In Progress): The number of work items started but not finished.

* Throughput: The number of work items finished per unit of time. Note the measurement of throughput is the exact count of work items.

* Work Item Age: The amount of elapsed time between when a work item started and the current time.

* Cycle Time: The amount of elapsed time between when a work item started and when a work item finished.

**Answer:**

**Definition of Done (DoD)** is a list of requirements that a user story must adhere to for the team to call it complete. While the Acceptance Criteria of a User Story consist of set of Test Scenarios that are to be met to confirm that the software is working as expected.

The difference between these two is that the DoD is common for all the User Stories whereas the Acceptance Criteria is applicable to specific User Story. Acceptance Criteria of each User Story will be different based on the requirements of that User Story.

In other words, Both DoD and Acceptance Criteria must be met in order to complete the User Story.  The Product Increment is not considered to be complete, unless both these two lists are done. Thus, we need to define two aspects of the Definition of Done (DOD) – Completion Criteria and Acceptance Criteria:

## Q3: How to build Continuous Delivery Pipeline with DevOps in SAFe 5.1?

**Difficulty:** `Senior`

**Source:**

https://www.scaledagileframework.com/continuous-delivery-pipeline/#:~:text=The%20Four%20Aspects,long%20after%20release.

**Answer:**

The SAFe continuous delivery pipeline contains four aspects: continuous exploration, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and release on demand. The CDP enables organizations to map their current pipeline into a new structure and then use relentless improvement to deliver value to customers. Feedback loops that exist internally within and between the aspects, and externally between the customers and the enterprise, fuel improvements. Internal feedback loops often center on process improvements, while external feedback often centers on solution improvements. Collectively, the improvements create synergy in ensuring the enterprise is ‘building the right thing, the right way’ and delivering value to the market frequently.

**NOTE**: A shorter version that I used to remember key points.

*Continuous Exploration* - Understand Customer needs - Hypothesize, Collaborate & Research, Architect, Synthesize;

*Continuous Integration* – A critical technical practice of the ART - Develop, Build, Test End-to-End, Stage;

*Continuous Deployment* – Getting to production early - Deploy, Verify, Monitor, Respond - Deploy to Staging every Iteration, Automate deployment, Automate testing of features and NFRs, Decouple deployment from release;

*Release on Demand* - Release, Stabilize, Measure, Learn.
