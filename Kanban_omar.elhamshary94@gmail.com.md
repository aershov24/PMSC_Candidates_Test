**Details:**   
Assume you are a project manager in an agile environment working with scrum practices. While checking project progress, you find out that your team is not delivering results as expected and is busy working on many tasks instead of delivering tasks. You decide to implement a new approach, what new approach would you use? And why?   


**Answer:**  
I would use Kanban method, because it focuses on limiting the work in progress (WIP) so the team is concerned with finishing existing work. The Kanban method is about focusing on completing work than starting new piece of work.

**Details:**   
You are managing an agile project using Kanban method. The project is on progress and the product owner asks you to add additional tasks to the backlog because this is customer requirements. When can you add the new tasks? Would you wait till the end of the iteration?    

**Answer:**
I will add the task immediately to the Kanban board. Contrary to scrum, you can change/add tasks even when the iterations have begun. Kanban do not use the concept of sprint backlog. So, you can re-order tasks priority and choose what to perform next at any stage.

**Details:**  
You are responsible for managing a project using Kanban method. Your customer understand that you cannot predict exact delivery dates in agile projects, however they ask you to provide an estimate on when the project will be completed. 
What would be your best course of action to address their question?    

**Answer:**  
First of all, it is important to know some Kanban metrices like Throughput which is: the number of cards delivered within a specific time period. 
So, assuming that for a specific release we have a total of 50 tasks in backlog. And we have throughput of 5 cards per week. We can estimate that we need 10 weeks to complete this release.
