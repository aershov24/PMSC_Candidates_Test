**Title:** Five Principles for successful _Kanban_?
**Description:** `What are the five principles that comprise successful Kanban in a software environment`
**Answer:**
Toyota first introduce Kanban into their Production System and they have defined five principles that comprise successful Kanban in software development: 
1. Visualize workflow - The team creates a map of the value stream in a form of a Kanban board
2. Limit work-in-progress - Set a limit on how many tasks can be in any step at a time to prevend inefficiency
3. Measure and manage flow - there are metrics that serve as information radiators for the team to measure how effective their current system is working. Some of them may include: Lead and Cycle Time; Throughput; Cumulative Flow Diagram
4. Make process policies explicit - The process the team follows is based on policies, making them explicit helps eliminate assumptions about work rules
5. Continuous Improvement -  Kanban encourages continuous improvement, also known as Kaizen. Every member of the team has a voice in deciding the best way to perform the work.

Hired as an Agile coach, the CEO of the company Alex, is asking you to observe and analyze the Way of Work in the company. Knowing microservice architecture and Kanban, what are some of the pinpoints you will look to validate during your observation phase?
**Answer:** Companies choose to use Kanban as their main framework when they have high uncertainty of what will come up in the next few weeks. Production issues, bug fixes and changing priorities are some of the reasons why companies choose to use Kanban over a sprint based frameworks. Knowing that, here're some pintpoints the Agile coach could look for to validate:
Product ownership:
- The Product owner splits stories no bigger than a week of work
- The process allows the PO to be flexible as the Priorities are chaning on a daily basis
- Production issues and Bugs are being created and prioritized as High on a daily basis
Development:
- To satisfy cleint expectations, the team works more on a reactive mode than proactive
DevOps:
- Even though the business is uncertain about what will be released in the next release, Microservice architecture allows DevOps to deploy changes without having a monolith downtime
