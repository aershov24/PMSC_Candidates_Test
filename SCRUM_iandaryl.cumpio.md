**Answer:**

**Incremental-** You are building as required by the clients without thorough modification or functional flexibility unless required to.

**Agile-** You're setting up meetings in order to **_gather requirement_**, **_assign tasks_**, **_monitor progress_** and **_deliver the changes_** in a fast paced scenario, changes are implemented during development once it was identified during development.

**Waterfall-** As the name suggests, you conduct the **_Data Gathering_**, **_Creation of design_**, **_implementation_**, **_verification_** before you can proceed to any other changes are then identified after the initial request has been provided.

As a Project Manager it is necessary to identify what are our deliverables both to **_our Client_** and **_within our team_**.
**_Internal Deliverables_** such as **Feasibiity Studies**, **Project Plan** & **Client Requirements** are to submitted to internal stakeholders & our team in order to evaluate the projected expenses and manpower required  in order to finish the client requirements.

**_External Deliverables_**  such as **The Project Prototypes**, **Progress Reports** & **Statement of Work** are to be submitted to the Clients in order for them to have a visual on the state of the project whether the target set by the team are being met.

**Answer:**

As the Project Manager, not only do we communicate with our clients, we also manage our team and a **_conflicts_** may lead to delays in our project deliverables

**_Communication-_** For an effective team, we need to communicate what are the requirements and to whom the task are being assigned to.
**_Active listening-_** Being an active listener means you're giving time to understand what your team members are discussing, this is important esp. when discussing bugs/additional features.
**_Negotiation-_** Being able to set a compromise when faced with a conflict will help both the team & client requirement without sacrificing the other end.
**_Collaboration-_** Being a Team means we also need to know what are the capabilities within and listen to new ideas and suggestions
**_Stress management-_** We must also learn to know our limits and de-stressing the team, this will also motivate the team which can help with delivering timely & efficiently.
**_Emotional awareness-_** Being professionals, we need to deal with internal conflicts professionally which means we must defend our position without going out of the line by attacking personally.
