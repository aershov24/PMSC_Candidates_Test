## Q2.	What is the difference between Kanban Cadences and Kanban feedback loop?

**Difficulty:** `Senior`

**Source**: https://pm.stackexchange.com/questions/27651/are-kanban-cadences-and-kanban-feedback-loops-are-the-same-thing

**Answer:** 
A cadence is a regular rhythm of activity. For example, in Scrum, most ceremonies have a once-per-sprint cadence. I'm guessing they use the term "cadence" instead of frequency because they want to remove the time-based association of frequency and instead allow for more event-based occurrence. For example, you might choose to review each feature instead of all features at the end of each sprint if you're taking more of a Kanban approach. 
Cadence describes the regularity in which you do certain activities. Those activities may be important in the feedback process, but the cadence itself is not the feedback loop. 



## Q3.	What is Kanban swimlanes and when do you use them?

**Difficulty:** `Mid`

**Answer:** 
Kanban board swimlanes are rows on a Kanban board. Those rows allow us to define the classes of service by visual separation. This increases documentation power for a Kanban board as well as tidily groups tasks according to certain classification criteria. We use Swimlanes to hurry an urgent task without completing the current work.
